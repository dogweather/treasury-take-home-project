== Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for the *Label Compliance Analysis* take-home project for the IT Specialist (Artificial Intelligence) position at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The focus of this submission is on **design clarity, architectural reasoning, and testable requirements** in a constrained delivery window, prioritizing a working core and clean documentation over incomplete features as specified in the assignment.

This README provides orientation to the project scope, artifacts supplied, and design decisions made.

== Contents

* `docs/` — Structured design artifacts
** Functional Requirements Document (FRD)
** Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
* `infra/` — Server configuration notes
* `ocr/` — Local OCR experimentation (pytesseract)
* `tests/` — Acceptance test scaffolding (Checkly / Playwright placeholders)
* `README.adoc` — Project overview

== Status

As of submission:

* Local Ubuntu VM provisioned and configured
* Pytesseract OCR installed and exercised
* Design artifacts drafted
* Repository structured for incremental development

Due to the time constraint and prioritization of architectural artifacts and executable test specifications, the core compliance features are scoped as skeleton implementations with clear next steps.

== Deliverables

=== Functional Requirements Document

The FRD captures user needs, system boundaries, and measurable acceptance criteria aligned to stakeholder interviews and the assignment rubric.

* Link: xref:Functional-Requirements-Document.adoc[Functional Requirements Document]

This document includes:
* Detailed use cases
* Input/output specifications
* Quality and performance expectations
* Constraint assumptions

=== Architectural Decision Records

A set of ADRs that document the rationale, alternatives considered, chosen approaches, and consequences for major architectural choices.

* Link: xref:Architecture-Decision-Records.adoc[Architectural Decision Records]

These ADRs cover:
* Baseline processing strategy (local vs. cloud)
* Service boundaries and framework selection
* Sync vs. async processing model
* Test strategy and executable requirements
* Confidence scoring model
* Optional GovCloud integration

== Proposed Execution Plan

This repository is structured to support:
* Incremental implementation via TDD/BDD
* Clear API contract definition and mock tests
* Human review queue and evidence traceability
* Synthetic monitoring via automated acceptance tests

=== Next Work Packages

A non-exhaustive list of remaining tasks:
* Implement core extraction pipelines
* Formalize OCR service API and Rails backend
* Integrate queue workers and job orchestration
* Expand acceptance test coverage
* Enable evidence visualization and confidence reporting

== How to Use This Repo

1. Review the FRD and ADRs to understand the problem space and design intent.
2. Examine the acceptance tests in `tests/` as executable requirements.
3. Explore `ocr/` for initial OCR service experiments.
4. Extend implementation against the scaffolded test harness.
